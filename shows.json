Far from home and desperate for answers, Jason washes up on the shores of an ancient land. A mysterious place; a world of bull leaping, of snake haired goddesses and of palaces so vast it was said they were built by giants - this is the city of Atlantis. Aided by his two new friends, Pythagoras and Hercules, Jason embarks on a voyage of discovery, and salvation, which sees him brush shoulders with Medusa, come face to face with the Minotaur and even do battle with the dead.","title":"Atlantis (2013)","banner":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/graphical\/248596-g4.jpg","fanart":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/fanart\/original\/248596-1.jpg","poster":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/posters\/248596-6.jpg","seasons":[1,2],"episodes":[{"season":1,"number":1,"title":"The Earth Bull","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/4096825.jpg"},{"season":1,"number":2,"title":"A Girl by Any Other Name","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/4651952.jpg"},{"season":1,"number":3,"title":"A Boy of No Consequence","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/4660653.jpg"},{"season":1,"number":4,"title":"Twist of Fate","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/4660654.jpg"},{"season":1,"number":5,"title":"White Lies","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/4660655.jpg"},{"season":1,"number":6,"title":"The Song of the Sirens","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/4660656.jpg"},{"season":1,"number":7,"title":"The Rules of Engagement","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/4660657.jpg"},{"season":1,"number":8,"title":"The Furies","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/4660658.jpg"},{"season":1,"number":9,"title":"Pandora's Box","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/4660659.jpg"},{"season":1,"number":10,"title":"The Price of Hope","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/4660660.jpg"},{"season":1,"number":11,"title":"Hunger Pangs","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/4660661.jpg"},{"season":1,"number":12,"title":"Touched by the Gods (1)","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/4660662.jpg"},{"season":1,"number":13,"title":"Touched by the Gods (2)","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/4660663.jpg"},{"season":2,"number":1,"title":"A New Dawn (1)","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/5009979.jpg"},{"season":2,"number":2,"title":"A New Dawn (2)","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/5041163.jpg"},{"season":2,"number":3,"title":"Telemon","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/5041164.jpg"},{"season":2,"number":4,"title":"The Marriage of True Minds","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/5047383.jpg"},{"season":2,"number":5,"title":"The Day of the Dead","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/5047384.jpg"},{"season":2,"number":6,"title":"The Grey Sisters","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/5047385.jpg"},{"season":2,"number":7,"title":"A Fate Worse Than Death","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/5179647.jpg"},{"season":2,"number":8,"title":"The Madness of Hercules","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/5189626.jpg"},{"season":2,"number":9,"title":"The Gorgon's Gaze","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/5196922.jpg"},{"season":2,"number":10,"title":"The Dying of the Light","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/5202020.jpg"},{"season":2,"number":11,"title":"Kin","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/5210722.jpg"},{"season":2,"number":12,"title":"The Queen Must Die","image":"http:\/\/thetvdb.com\/banners\/_cache\/episodes\/248596\/5220562.jpg"}]},{"tvdb_id":248736,"imdb_id":"tt1830617","overview":"Nick Burkhardt thought he prepared himself for the realities of working as a homicide detective until he started seeing things he couldn't explain.
